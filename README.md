# CAP4053 - Shadow of the Sword
The final project for CAP 4053-AI for Game Programming at UCF, a video game created during a single semester by four students.

Shadow of the Sword is video game created using Unity and C#. The game is focused on combat with two different types of enemies with probability based attacks and ability for players to parry attacks.

## Contributers 
- Megan Murphy
- Hunter Davis
- Julien Nashi
- Jacob Roberts

## How to play the game
- Left click mouse to hit an enemy
- Right click mouse to parry
- Click ‘E’ to read in-game books
- Left Shift is for dashing and stamina 
- Regular WASD controller movement 
- 'ESC' shows the mouse

## Bugs
Players can use blocks on the walls to jump. This was originally a bug but was kept because it made navigating the map more interesting.
Sprinting, moving backwards, and parrying/attacking would allow for faster movement through the level. In the case that someone wanted to find the fastest way through the game, this would be a potential method to follow.
